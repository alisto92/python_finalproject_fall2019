This repository contains a final report and supporting Jupyter notebooks created by my team for our final project in the Python Fundamentals for Data Science for Masters candidates in the Information & Data Science program offered through University of California Berkeley's School of Information.

We ingested, cleaned, and explored data related to building energy use and built a well-performing model predicting a building's energy use based on features related to location, weather, and time. 

The data and inspiration for this project came from a Kaggle competition, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction 

Our final project report is found in the PDF file in this repository: Project2_FinalReport_Hua_Skowronski_Stover.pdf

Please refer to the Jupyter notebooks for additional details of our data processing, exploration, and analysis.
